# Uber_DE_Project

In this DataEngineering project I have used data from TCL trip record data. I'm dividing the scrap data into facts and dimansions to perform ETL process on the data using MAGE. I am using Google Cloud Platform(GCP) for data warehousing and LOOKER for data visualisation. This is the practice project where I am applying and practicing my expertise in DataEngineering. 

Check out the final basic usable dashboard which can help the business user to take critical business decisions. You can check the average amount, average tip, total revenue, average trip distance. Also you can check the pickup locations details on the maps. Refer the following link.
